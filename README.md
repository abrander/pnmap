Requirements
------------

A working Go environment is required for compiling, and a Linux, BSD or
macOS host is required for running.

Compiling
---------

The usual `go mod download`, `go generate` and `go build` should suffice.

Running
-------
List network interfaces by invoking `./pnmap list`.

Monitoring a live network can be done like `./pnmap monitor -i eno1`.

Replaying a pcap file: `./pnmap simulate capture-file.pcap`.
